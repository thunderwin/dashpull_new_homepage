Our trading model is provable, traceable, and verifiable. You just need to follow us for a while, and you will find out whether what we say is true or not.",{"quote":101},"\u003Cstrong>Can using your service guarantee making money?\u003C/strong> No. In fact, no one in this world can guarantee that you will make money by doing anything. But we are likely to help you make money, because our predictive ability can be verified, it's not by chance, everything is based on mathematics.",{"quote":103},"\u003Cstrong>How should I verify your AI capabilities?\u003C/strong> Actually, it's very simple. You just need to subscribe to our mailing list, and we will send you the encrypted trading direction before each transaction every day. Or even simpler, you can directly subscribe to our Telegram channel, where we will simultaneously publish our predictions so you can verify them after we complete the transactions.

We may explore completing transactions through decentralized exchanges in the future, if it can save on fees.",{"quote":109},"\u003Cstrong>Why do you release a ciphertext before trading?\u003C/strong> The purpose of releasing the ciphertext is to prove that we indeed rely on predictions for trading, but at the same time, we do not need to expose our direction in advance. Otherwise, others could imitate our strategy. Our design is to prove that the profits we bring to you are indeed obtained through trading, not a Ponzi scheme.",{"quote":111},"\u003Cstrong>How can I confirm or ensure that your ciphertext is genuine?\u003C/strong> We will release the original text at the end of the transaction.
