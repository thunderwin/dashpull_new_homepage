# Dashpull's Nine-Year Journey: From AI Dreams to Automated Trading Reality

Dashpull didn't appear suddenly, but is based on years of exploration and practice. We began exploring AGI-based financial predictions in 2016, and finally achieved daily Bitcoin prediction and automated trading in 2025. This is a nine-year journey filled with challenges, failures, and breakthroughs.

## Timeline of Nine Years of Exploration

### 2016: First Encounter with AI Power
**Sophia Robot Project**

Everything started with the Sophia Robot project. It was our first real encounter with AI technology, and we were deeply shocked by the potential of artificial intelligence. Although AI was still primitive at that time, we began to think: if AI can simulate human thinking, could it also understand and predict the patterns of financial markets?

### 2017: Entering the Blockchain World
**First Foray into Cryptocurrency Trading**

Participating in blockchain projects gave us our first exposure to cryptocurrency trading. Although we didn't delve deep into research at the time, this experience planted seeds for our later exploration. We began to realize that beyond traditional financial markets, there existed a completely new world of trading full of possibilities.

### 2018: First Attempt
**AI Prediction of Cryptocurrency Trends**

We enthusiastically attempted to use AI to predict cryptocurrency trends, but ended up failing. However, this failure was not meaningless - it gave us a deep understanding of the complexity of financial markets and laid an important foundation for later research. We began to realize that relying solely on technology was not enough; we needed deeper market understanding.

### 2019: Embracing the Large Model Era
**Attempting LLM Financial Market Prediction**

With the open-sourcing of OpenAI GPT-2, we saw new hope. We attempted to use large language models to predict financial markets, but failed again. Although the results were disappointing, this experience gave us a deeper understanding of AI's limitations and possibilities.

### 2020: Critical Shift in Thinking
**Using Stock Data to Predict Cryptocurrency Trends**

This was a crucial turning point. We changed our approach and began using stock data to predict cryptocurrency trends. The most critical insight was: we realized that global financial data is interconnected. There exists an intrinsic correlation between traditional financial markets and cryptocurrency markets, and this discovery laid the theoretical foundation for our later breakthroughs.

### 2021: Continued Exploration
**Working hard...**

This was a challenging year. We continued moving forward on the path of exploration, constantly trying new methods and technologies. Although there were no major breakthroughs, each attempt accumulated valuable experience and data.

### 2022: Dawn Before Success
**Seeing Hope**

After years of effort, we finally saw a glimmer of hope. Although we were still far from success, this was enough to keep us going. We began to believe that our direction was correct.

### 2023: First Generation Product Launch
**Launched First Generation Product**

Finally, we launched our first generation product, achieving cryptocurrency trend prediction. We achieved 70% returns that year, which excited us immensely. However, this version required manual participation and had very few trades. Nevertheless, this was already an important milestone.

### 2024: AI Stable Operation
**No Longer Requiring Manual Participation**

After difficult exploration and optimization, we finally achieved stable AI operation without manual participation. The system could trade almost daily, marking our significant transition from manual operations to automated trading.

### 2025: Dreams Come True
**Creating Dashpull Automated Trading Platform**

Nine years of exploration finally bore fruit. We launched a complete automated trading platform solution - Dashpull. This platform not only predicts Bitcoin trends daily but also automatically executes trades, truly realizing our original dream.

## Reflections on Nine Years of Exploration

Looking back at these nine years, we deeply understand that:

**Innovation Takes Time**: From our first encounter in 2016 to product success in 2025, nine years witnessed countless attempts and failures. True innovation doesn't happen overnight; it requires continuous effort and persistence.

**Failure is the Foundation of Success**: Each failure provided us with valuable experience. Without the failure of 2018, there would be no shift in thinking in 2020; without the setbacks of 2019, there would be no later technical accumulation.

**Importance of Cross-Domain Thinking**: From AI to blockchain, from large models to traditional finance, it was this cross-domain thinking that helped us find unique solutions. The insight that global financial data is interconnected came from this cross-domain thinking.

**Combination of Technology and Market**: Pure technical approaches don't work; we must deeply understand market patterns. Our success lies not only in technical advancement but also in deep understanding of market fundamentals.

## Today's Dashpull

Today's Dashpull is not just a trading platform, but an embodiment of nine years of exploratory spirit. We believe that at the intersection of AI and finance, there are more possibilities waiting for us to explore.

This nine-year journey tells us: true innovation requires time, patience, and persistence. We are proud to have come this far, but we know this is just a new beginning.
