There are many trading teams in the market that claim to be more professional than you, and they can provide enough evidence, such as real trading records, proving they have achieved several times or even dozens of times returns in the past few years. So why should I still use your service?

## This is a very interesting question, and also a confusing one.

First, you need to understand that cryptocurrencies have been in a major bull market over the past few years. That is to say, if there were a group of people who only went long, they would have achieved very good returns.

But here's a very crucial point: you now **already know that cryptocurrencies were in a bull market in the past few years**, but going back to a few years ago, you didn't know that BTC would eventually rise so high. Because you **have no way to foresee the future**. (If you can predict the future, I'm curious why you still have the time to read this article)

So, when you understand this point, you'll know that those with high returns may just be **survivors** because they ultimately got the direction right. This is where scams and confusion easily arise in financial markets. This doesn't prove they have some magical ability; they may just be lucky.

There are always a few people who can guess the direction correctly multiple times and achieve huge returns. But this doesn't prove they really understand the market; they may just be lucky.

Of course, if you are a firm BTC bull, I might actually congratulate you because you belong to the brave ones. Often, those who make big money are your type: firmly believing in their direction and boldly placing bets.

But most people don't have this courage to bet on one direction and stick to it. In fact, I don't recommend anyone to do this because life is not gambling.

But we are different. We are professional fund managers, and our profession doesn't allow us to firmly believe that something, some asset will definitely skyrocket. Although as a cryptocurrency enthusiast, I also think BTC is good, I can always list many events to reveal future risks. For example:

It's now 2025, President Trump is a changeable person. He initially supported cryptocurrencies, but maybe after two years in office, he suddenly abandons his support for cryptocurrencies.

The impact of new technologies on cryptocurrencies - who can tell?

The mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto suddenly appears, and his massive BTC holdings start flowing into the market.

A crypto whale suddenly changes his attitude toward cryptocurrencies and starts selling frantically.

Any of the events I mentioned could completely change the market. Then, **those who only go long will be brutally eliminated by the market**. And if you see them making money by going long in the past few years and believe they are masters, you will suffer heavy losses.

## So how can you avoid or identify this risk?

Actually, there's a way: see if they have neutral strategies. That is, do their trading strategies include strategies to deal with both market rises and falls? Whether the market is rising or falling, they can make money. This is what we call neutral strategies. Only such strategies won't experience **catastrophic losses**.

Speaking of this, many people complain that their fund manager's performance is not as good as the market. This is actually a bias of amateur investors. In fact, fund managers' abilities are definitely superior to ordinary people. The reason ordinary people think their invested funds haven't outperformed the market is because they're Monday morning quarterbacking. They already know the market is bullish, but if the market were bearish, they might have suffered huge losses, and they wouldn't complain about their fund manager anymore. In summary, an excellent fund manager must be able to profit steadily whether the market is rising or falling (at least when the market faces huge risks, losses are limited), which is key.

## Speaking of our strategy

Indeed, our returns are not particularly high. Compared to those who show off their several times or dozens of times returns in the media, we really don't amount to much. But our strategy perfectly meets the following points:

* **Bias toward neutral strategy**: We can both go long and short. No matter what state the market is in, we can make money with a stable win rate.
* **Daily settlement**: We don't have long-term lockups. When the market faces huge crises, users can withdraw at any time.
* **Verifiable trading strategy**: Our trading has patterns and can be verified. We won't have situations where a fund doesn't trade for several months and then suddenly makes a lot of money in one trade. Such trading strategies have great uncertainty, making it impossible for you to verify their ability. What if their next risky trade fails? This worry will prevent you from increasing capital and leverage on them because their trading model has strong uncertainty.

> But ours is different. Our trading model is very certain: we trade once a day. This strategy is hard-won, and returns can be amplified through increasing capital or leverage. This depends on how much you understand our AI and how much confidence you have in us.

## So we don't envy those crazy returns because we know they're unreplicable and have strong randomness.

## Conclusion

When facing investment, many things are different from what we think. We need to explore the reasons behind them to avoid suffering major losses.
