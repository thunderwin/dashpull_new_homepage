# How to Use DashPull: A Simple Trading Guide

Welcome to DashPull! Today we'll show you exactly how to use our AI predictions to make money in the markets.

## What is DashPull?

DashPull is a simple tool that uses AI to predict if the stock market will go up or down each day. Here's what makes us special:

- **We're right 70% of the time** - We've checked this with lots of past data
- **We make about 0.4% profit per day** - It sounds small, but it adds up fast!
- **Our AI is really smart** - We've been working on it for years
- **We tell you every day** - You get our prediction 90 minutes before the market opens

## How Good Are Our Predictions?

We've tested our predictions on tons of old data, and we're right **more than 70% of the time**. We make about **0.4% profit each day** on average. 

That might not sound like much, but here's the thing: if you make 0.4% every day, it really adds up over time!

The best part? Everything we do is **totally open**. We publish our predictions before trading, and then we show you the results after. No hiding anything!

## The Most Important Thing: We Tell You Which Way the Market Will Go

Here's the **most important thing** you need to know:

> **Direction is everything!**

We don't try to guess exactly how much the market will move. That's really hard to do right. Instead, we focus on telling you if the market will go **up or down**. 

When we guess the exact numbers, we're only right about 50% of the time. But when we tell you the direction (up or down), we're right **more than 70% of the time**. That's our superpower!

## Two Ways to Trade

We suggest two different ways to trade, depending on how much experience you have:

### Method 1: Just Follow What We Say (Easy Way)

This is the simple way. Perfect for beginners or people who don't have time to watch the market all day.

**How to do it:**
- If we say "buy," you buy
- If we say "sell," you sell
- Don't think about it, just do it

**SUPER IMPORTANT: Always set a stop loss!**

Why? Because sometimes we're wrong! If the market goes really bad and drops 5%, you could lose months of profits. That's why you need a safety net.

**How to set your stop loss:**
- Make it big enough so small moves don't trigger it
- Let the market do its thing for the whole day
- Don't let small ups and downs scare you out

**The plan:**
Once you're in, just wait for the whole day to finish. Don't worry about what happens in the middle - just see how it ends.

### Method 2: Advanced Trading (Hard Way)

This is for people who really know what they're doing. You need experience for this one.

**Why is it harder?**
Let's say we predict the market will go up today. But when the market opens, it might go down first before going up. You have to figure out: Is this the lowest point of the day?

**The good and bad:**
- Bad: If you buy too early, it might keep dropping and hit your stop loss. Then it goes up without you. Super annoying!
- Good: If you time it right, you can get in at a much better price

**Pro moves:**
If you're really good at trading, you can buy and sell multiple times in the same day. You keep buying low and selling high because you know it's going up eventually.

**WARNING:**
If you get stopped out twice in the direction we predicted, maybe we were wrong that day. Don't keep trying - sometimes it's better to stop!

## What's the Big Difference Between These Two Ways?

**It's all about your stop loss size:**

- **Easy Way**: You use a bigger stop loss. This lets the market move around all day without kicking you out, but you won't lose too much if something really bad happens
- **Hard Way**: You use a tiny stop loss to try to make more money. This works better if you're using leverage (borrowed money)

## Our Plans

We keep it simple with just two plans:

### Free Plan
- You can see our predictions and scores every day
- We'll email you the predictions automatically
- Perfect if you want to try us out first

### Pro Plan
- Everything in the Free Plan
- Plus **Special High-Confidence Alerts** (about 3-4 times per month)
- These are the trades we're REALLY sure about - our AI is super confident these will work
- Great if you want to make more money

You can switch between plans anytime you want.

## Important Stuff You MUST Know

Let me be super clear about a few things:

1. **Nobody can promise you'll always make money** - not us, not anyone
2. **Always use stop losses** - this is your safety net, don't forget it!
3. **Don't bet money you can't afford to lose** - only use money you're okay with losing
4. **We're good at making steady profits over time** - we're not about getting rich quick

## Summary

Here's what DashPull does: We use AI to predict which way the market will go. We're right more than 70% of the time, and we make about 0.4% profit each day.

**Remember these important things:**
- Direction (up or down) is what matters most
- Always protect yourself with stop losses
- Pick the method that fits your experience level
- Stick to the plan
- Be patient - good results take time
