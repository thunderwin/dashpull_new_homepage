If you ask me whether there are strategies with high win rates, strong profitability, and good risk-reward ratios in the market, I can tell you responsibly: there are indeed.

There are indeed some almost "free money" risk-free opportunities in the world, but ordinary people cannot access these opportunities at all, nor would they be allowed to participate with your funds. If you encounter such opportunities, you should suspect they might just be scams. Because you should think: why would such good things fall to you? And you should spend three days thinking: why you?

Even if such opportunities are real, they may have a very big flaw: **small market capacity**

Such strategies are likely to use real trading records to attract your funds, but in reality, their strategies cannot carry too much capital. When the amount of funds becomes large, the strategy will fail. The key point is that their profit records may be real, but they conceal the characteristic of small market capacity. They may accept your funds, but actually cannot use your funds, nor can they deliver the returns they promise.

## You need to always remember: a good strategy must meet the following characteristics

**Trading must be frequent enough, with certainty and stability:** An excellent strategy should be able to run continuously under different market conditions, rather than relying on chance.

**Returns and losses must be gradual, not too volatile:** If returns are too volatile, it indicates they may just be accidental luck rather than real strength.

**Market capacity must be large enough:** Only in this way does it make sense for your funds to enter. If the capacity is too small and the strategy cannot carry more funds, why would they need your funds?

**Must be biased toward neutral strategies:** Whether the market goes up or down, the strategy should be able to cope. You need to see if its performance is consistent in bull markets, bear markets, and sideways markets.

We have another article that explains in detail how to scientifically evaluate an excellent strategy.

## Summary: How to judge whether a strategy is reliable?

**1. You need to look at their historical performance and ensure that the historical performance published by the other party is real**

**2. Use the 7 principles we mentioned to evaluate the strategy**

**3. Ask yourself: Why me?** If a strategy looks too good to be true, then it very likely is not true. Truly high-quality strategies usually do not publicly recruit funds from ordinary investors.

If you can do these things, you will be better able to identify real opportunities and avoid falling into scams.

## Conclusion

In financial markets, there is no free lunch. Truly excellent strategies need to stand the test of time, with stability, sustainability, and appropriate market capacity. As investors, we must remain rational and vigilant, not be fooled by superficial high returns.

Remember: if an opportunity looks too good to be true, it very likely is not true. Always ask yourself "why me?" - this will help you avoid most investment traps.
